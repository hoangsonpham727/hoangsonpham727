## üß† What Drives Me

I believe that **data is the bridge between curiosity and innovation**. With each project, I aim to:
- Uncover **actionable insights** from raw data
- Build **interpretable and robust ML models**
- Tackle **real-world challenges** with applied AI
- Constantly refine my understanding through **experimentation and intuition**

My projects blend statistical rigor with software engineering best practices to deliver solutions that are not only performant but also explainable and ethical.

## üöÄ Key Projects & Highlights

### Analysis of discussion on ChatGPT in StackExchange (2025)
- Advanced Text Analytics: Applied NLP techniques to analyze 390+ ChatGPT-related posts, revealing key discussion patterns and sentiment trends in the data science community.
- Sentiment Classification: Developed a sentiment analysis pipeline that revealed a striking contrast between posts (mostly positive) and comments (predominantly neutral), suggesting initial enthusiasm followed by more critical discussion.
- Geospatial Visualization: Created interactive maps showing the global distribution of ChatGPT discussions, with Europe, Asia, and North America emerging as key engagement hubs.
- Thematic Analysis: Leveraged AI-powered tools to categorize discussions, identifying technical implementation as the dominant theme followed by ethical concerns about AI.
- Visual Data Storytelling: Generated comprehensive visualizations including sentiment-specific word clouds, regional distribution charts, and feature correlation heatmaps to communicate complex patterns.

###  Diabetes Risk Factor Analysis using NHANES Dataset
- Comprehensive Data Integration: Successfully merged multiple NHANES datasets (demographics, dietary intake, body measurements, blood pressure readings, and glycohemoglobin) to create a holistic view of diabetes risk factors.
- Advanced Data Visualization: Implemented interactive visualizations using Bokeh, including correlation heatmaps, 3D cluster projections, and radar charts to reveal complex patterns in high-dimensional health data.
- Unsupervised Learning Application: Applied K-means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms to identify natural groupings in the population based on health parameters, revealing distinct dietary and metabolic profiles beyond traditional clinical classifications.
- Risk Factor Quantification: Calculated odds ratios for key diabetes risk factors, demonstrating that age, waist circumference, BMI, and blood pressure were the strongest predictors of diabetes status.
